# Storing and Maintaining Secrets, API Keys, and Passwords

## Introduction
In software development, it is crucial to securely store and manage sensitive information such as secrets, API keys, and passwords. This guide will provide an overview of the process and commands involved in storing and maintaining these secrets using the `pass` command-line tool.

## Prerequisites
Before getting started, ensure that you have the `pass` command-line tool installed on your system. You can download and install it from the [passwordstore.org](https://www.passwordstore.org/) website.

## Workflow

### Generating and Managing GPG Keys
To encrypt and decrypt secrets stored with `pass`, you need to generate and manage GPG (GNU Privacy Guard) keys. Follow the steps below:

#### Generate a New GPG Key
To generate a new GPG key, use the following command:
```bash
gpg --gen-key
```

#### List GPG Key Details
To list the details of your GPG keys, use the following command:
```bash
gpg -K
```

#### Edit an Existing GPG Key
To edit an existing GPG key, use the following commands:
```bash
gpg --edit-key <key_id>
trust
expire
save
```

### Storing and Managing Secrets

#### Adding a New Secret
To add a new secret to the `pass` directory, use the following command:
```bash
pass insert <secret_name>
```
*Note: When naming secrets, avoid using Personally Identifiable Information (PII) as it will be visible within the directory.*

#### Editing an Existing Secret
To edit an existing secret, use the following command:
```bash
pass edit <secret_name>
```

#### Finding an Existing Secret
To find an existing secret, use the following command:
```bash
pass find <secret_name>
```

### Version Control Integration

#### Adding a GitHub Remote Repository
To add a GitHub remote repository for version control, use the following command:
```bash
pass git remote add <remote_name> git@github.com-<ssh_profile>:repo/path.git 
```

## Conclusion
By following the steps and commands outlined in this guide, you can securely store and manage secrets, API keys, and passwords using the `pass` command-line tool. Remember to always prioritize the security of sensitive information in your software development projects.
