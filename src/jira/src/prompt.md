## Prompt 1:
```sh
I have a greenfeild project with the following requirements:

- Use python and pyspark to query and load data from Jira Api
into the databricks environment
- Data update cadence is weekly
- The required python package atlassian-python-api and we need 
to utilize the databricks environment


Can you create a project plan for the path foward to acheive these goals?
```

## Response 1:
```sh
I have a greenfield project with the following requirements:

- Use python and pyspark to query and load data from Jira API into the Databricks environment.
- The data update cadence is weekly.
- The required python package is atlassian-python-api, and we need to utilize the Databricks environment.

To achieve these goals, we can follow the following project plan:

1. Set up the Databricks environment:
   - Create a Databricks workspace.
   - Set up a cluster with the required configurations.

2. Install the necessary packages:
   - Install Python and PySpark on the Databricks cluster.
   - Install the atlassian-python-api package.

3. Connect to the Jira API:
   - Obtain the necessary credentials and API token for accessing the Jira API.
   - Write Python code to authenticate and establish a connection with the Jira API.

4. Query and load data from Jira:
   - Define the data requirements and the specific Jira API endpoints to query.
   - Use Python and PySpark to retrieve the required data from the Jira API.
   - Transform and load the data into the Databricks environment.

5. Automate the data update process:
   - Set up a weekly job or schedule in Databricks to run the data retrieval and loading process.
   - Ensure that the job runs successfully and handles any potential errors or exceptions.

6. Test and validate the solution:
   - Develop test cases to verify the correctness of the data retrieval and loading process.
   - Validate the accuracy and completeness of the loaded data.

7. Document the project:
   - Create documentation that outlines the project requirements, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.
   - Document the data update cadence and any relevant information for future reference.

By following this project plan, we can successfully query and load data from the Jira API into the Databricks environment using Python and PySpark. The data update process will be automated on a weekly basis, ensuring that the data is always up to date.

## Prompt 2:
```sh
Provide the code for the Jira object to initiatiaze with user details:
jira_user: string
Jira_host: string
jira_api_key: string
```

## Response 2:
```python
# Initialize Jira object with user details
jira_user = "<username>"
jira_host = "<hostname>"
jira_api_key = "<api_key>"

jira = JIRA(server=jira_host, basic_auth=(jira_user, jira_api_key))
```

# Scope the execution to a single Jira Project in order
# to query the  Issues Table, Issue Type Table, Epic Table, Components Table,
# Issue-Component Link Table, Issue Change Log Table, and other jira object.
```python
# Scope the execution to a single Jira Project
project_key = "<project_key>"

# Query the Issues Table
issues = jira.search_issues("project={}".format(project_key))

# Query the Issue Type Table
issue_types = jira.issue_types(project_key)

# Query the Epic Table
epics = jira.epics(project_key)

# Query the Components Table
components = jira.components(project_key)

# Query the Issue-Component Link Table
issue_component_links = jira.issue_component_links(project_key)

# Query the Issue Change Log Table
issue_change_logs = jira.issue_change_logs(project_key)
```
