# Development Environment Setup

Setting up a development environment for working with Firebase, Vue.js, and cloud functions involves several steps, especially when you're using NeoVim on WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux). Here's a guide to get you started:
## 1. Setting Up WSL2

Ensure you have WSL2 installed on your Windows system. If not, you can install it by following the steps on the official Microsoft documentation.
## 2. Installing Node.js and NPM

Vue.js and Firebase require Node.js. Install it inside your WSL2 Linux distribution:

Update and Upgrade Packages:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```
Install Node.js:

```bash
sudo apt install nodejs
```
Install NPM (Node Package Manager):

```bash
sudo apt install npm
```
## 3. Install Vue CLI

Vue CLI is a standard tool for Vue.js development. Install it globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g @vue/cli
```

Configure NeoVim:

* Create a ~/.config/nvim directory if it doesn't exist.
* Place your configuration files inside this directory.


## 4. Install Firebase CLI

Firebase CLI is essential for managing Firebase services, including cloud functions:

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

Initialize Firebase in Your Project:

Inside your Vue project directory, run:

```bash
firebase init
```
Follow the prompts to set up Hosting, Functions, and other services you need.

## 5. Create a Vue Project

Create a new Vue.js project using the Vue CLI:

```bash
vue create my-vue-project
cd my-vue-project
```
## 6. Set Up Firebase in Your Project

Initialize Firebase in your project:

```bash
firebase init
```
Follow the prompts to set up Firestore, Functions, and Hosting for your project. Ensure you're logged into Firebase in your CLI.
## 7. Install Firebase SDK

Install Firebase SDK in your Vue project to interact with Firebase services:

```bash
npm install firebase
```
## 8. Configure NeoVim for Vue.js Development

    Ensure NeoVim is installed on your WSL2.

    For Vue.js development, you might want to install plugins like coc.nvim for IntelliSense, linting, and formatting. Add these to your ~/.config/nvim/init.vim:

    vim

Plug 'neoclide/coc.nvim', {'branch': 'release'}

You can also install a Vue syntax highlighting plugin:

vim

    Plug 'posva/vim-vue'

    Run :PlugInstall in NeoVim to install the plugins.

## 9. Configure Firebase and Vue.js Integration

    In your Vue project, you can now import and configure Firebase to connect to your Firebase services.
    Set up environment variables in your Vue project for Firebase configuration.

## 10. Develop Cloud Functions

    Navigate to the functions directory created by Firebase in your project.
    Write your cloud functions in this directory using JavaScript or TypeScript.

## 11. Testing and Deployment

    Test your Vue.js application and Firebase functions locally.

    Once everything is working as expected, deploy your application using the Firebase CLI:

    bash

    firebase deploy

Remember, this is a basic setup. Depending on your project's requirements, you might need additional configurations or tools. Always refer to the official Vue.js, and Firebase.
